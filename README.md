# YACLC
Yet Another ACL Compiler

Yaaclc stands in the shoulder of aclc and is an atempt to improve the compiler characteristics of aclc. Yaaclc needs to give syntax warnings and compilation errors.


## Motivation 

As aclc is a language converter which converts ACL program to perl and evaluate it, it doesn't give any feedback on the code quality. Any error message while running the code is a perl runtime error. Thus there was the necessity of a tool which enables us to have syntax errors and compiling errors.
